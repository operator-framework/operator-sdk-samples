# Memcached Helm Operator

## Overview

This Memcached operator is a simple example of the Operator SDK Helm-based operator. It is based on the [`stable/memcached` chart][stable/memcached] .

## Prerequisites

- [docker][docker_tool] version 17.03+
- [kubectl][kubectl_tool] v1.14.1+
- [operator SDK][operator_install]
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.16.0+ cluster.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

Checkout this Memcached operator repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk-samples.git
cd operator-sdk-samples/helm/memcached-operator
```

### Build the operator image

Build the Memcached operator image and push it to a public registry, such as quay.io:

```sh
export IMAGE=quay.io/example-inc/memcached-operator:v0.0.1
make docker-build docker-push IMG=$IMAGE
```

**NOTE** To allow the cluster pull the image the repository needs to be set as public or you must configure an image pull secret.


### Run the operator

Deploy the project to the cluster. Set `IMG` with `make deploy` to use the image you just pushed:

```sh
make deploy IMG=$IMAGE
```

### Create a sample custom resource

Create a sample CR:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml -n memcached-operator-system
```

Run the following command to verify that the installation was successful:

```console
$ kubectl get all -n memcached-operator-system

```

### Clean up

Delete the CR to uninstall the release:
`
```sh
kubectl delete -f config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml -n memcached-operator-system
````

Use `make uninstall` and `make undeploy` to uninstall the operator and its CRDs:

```sh
make uninstall
make undeploy
```

### Troubleshooting

Run the following command to check the operator logs.

```sh
kubectl logs deployment.apps/memcached-operator-controller-manager -n memcached-operator-system -c manager
```

### Extras

This project was created by using the [gen-helm-memcached.sh][gen-helm-memcached.sh] script , which means that it is using the official [stable/memcached][stable/memcached] helm chart.

Note that you must have Helm installed locally and add the stable helm charts repo to it to use the `stable/memcached` Helm charts. See the [Helm Quickstart guide][helm-quick] for installation instructions. Also, you can start with Helm-based Operators with SDK by checking its [quickstart][helm_guide].
