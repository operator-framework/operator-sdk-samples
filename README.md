This project is a component of the [Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework), an open source toolkit to manage Kubernetes native applications, called Operators, in an effective, automated, and scalable way.

# Operator SDK Samples
This repo contains samples of operators built using the [operator-sdk][operator_sdk].

To view operators which leverage Go, Ansible, or Helm for deployment, see the [Go][go_examples], [Ansible][ansible_examples], or [Helm][helm_examples] samples sections, respectively.

**NOTE:** For examples of other operators, see the [Awesome Operators][awesome-operators] repo. However, note that not all of these operators were written using [operator-sdk][operator_sdk].
