# [DEPRECATED] Operator SDK Samples

This repository has been deprecated. The sample operator projects have been moved to `testdata/` in [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/) repository. For more info see the [enhancement proposal](https://github.com/operator-framework/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/samples-generation.md) for automatic sample generation using Go.  

This project is a component of the [Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework), an open source toolkit to manage Kubernetes native applications, called Operators, in an effective, automated, and scalable way. Read more in the [introduction blog post](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework).

Note that, the latest SDK released version used to update the samples is 1.1.0. 

## Overview

This repo contains samples of operators built using the [operator-sdk][operator_sdk].

To view operators which leverage Go, Ansible, or Helm for deployment, see the [Go][go_examples], [Ansible][ansible_examples], or [Helm][helm_examples] samples sections, respectively.

**NOTE:** For examples of other operators, see the [Awesome Operators][awesome-operators] repo. However, note that not all of these operators were written using [operator-sdk][operator_sdk].
